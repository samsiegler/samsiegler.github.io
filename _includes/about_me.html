            I have a degree in Computer Software Engineering from the University of Miami in Coral Gables, FL. Getting this degree gave me a solid background on Object Oriented Programming, Algorithms, Software Architecture, Embedded Systems, Relational Databases, and some more fun things like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelliegence.

           Ive always had a passion for building things. Back in middle school I made a Hovercraft that could withstand 50lbs! Theses days I have turned my focus from hands on work to software. For my senior project I built an iOS application that motivates people to lose weight by sending out an embarrsing picture of them if they dont meet their goal!
